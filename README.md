* I created this program for my dad to make VTO bidding easier.
* It reads a text file and determines who gets what bid lines.
* It then finds his last name and lets him know what lines are left that he chose in the order he bid them.

Example Output:

```
Calculating remaining lines   

Bids 25 21 29 31 are left for you!   

```

I have it set to use a text file called bids.txt in the same directory as it is. Run by:
```
./bid
```
